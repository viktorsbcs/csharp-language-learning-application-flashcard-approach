# Language learning console application using flashcard approach. #

Specify a text file that contains two words seperated by colon ':', where word on the left is from language you're learning and word on the right desired translation. Example:
der Morgen:morning

Launch console application and in the menu specify path to a text file and press generate. Application will randomly pick a key:value pair and show the foreign word that you would need to translate. If you don't remember the word, choose an option to display translation. Press button to randomly pick a new word and repeat the process until you've learned all the words from the text file.
